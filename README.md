## ‚ö°Ô∏è Requirements

* Neovim >= 0.8.0
* [nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig)
* [nvim-navic](https://github.com/SmiteshP/nvim-navic)
* [nui.nvim](https://github.com/MunifTanjim/nui.nvim)

## üì¶ Installation

Install the plugin with your preferred package manager:

### [packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)

```lua
use {
    "SmiteshP/nvim-navbuddy",
    requires = {
        "neovim/nvim-lspconfig",
        "SmiteshP/nvim-navic",
        "MunifTanjim/nui.nvim"
    }
}
```

### [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

```vim
Plug "neovim/nvim-lspconfig"
Plug "SmiteshP/nvim-navic"
Plug "MunifTanjim/nui.nvim"
Plug "SmiteshP/nvim-navbuddy"
Plug "numToStr/Comment.nvim",        " Optional
Plug "echasnovski/mini.comment",     " Optional
Plug "nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim" " Optional
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

nvim-navbuddy needs to be attached to lsp servers of the buffer to work. You can pass the
navbuddy's `attach` function as `on_attach` while setting up the lsp server. You can skip this
step if you have enabled `auto_attach` option in setup function.

Example:
```lua
local navbuddy = require("nvim-navbuddy")

require("lspconfig").clangd.setup {
    on_attach = function(client, bufnr)
        navbuddy.attach(client, bufnr)
    end
}
```

## ü™Ñ Customise

Use `setup` to override any of the default options

* `icons` : Indicate the type of symbol captured. Default icons assume you have nerd-fonts.
* `window` : Set options related to window's "border", "size", "position".
* `mappings` : Actions to be triggered for specified keybindings. If you wish to set custom keybindings, you will have to set all the keybindings.
* `lsp` :
	* `auto_attach` : Enable to have Navbuddy automatically attach to every LSP for current buffer. Its disabled by default.
	* `preference` : Table ranking lsp_servers. Lower the index, higher the priority of the server. If there are more than one server attached to a buffer, navbuddy will refer to this list to make a decision on which one to use.
			for example - In case a buffer is attached to clangd and ccls both and the preference list is `{ "clangd", "pyright" }`. Then clangd will be prefered.
* `source_buffer` :
	* `follow_node` : Keep the current node in focus on the source buffer
	* `highlight` : Highlight the currently focused node
	* reorient: Reorient buffer after changing nodes. options are "smart", "top", "mid" or "none"

```lua
local navbuddy = require("nvim-navbuddy")

navbuddy.setup {
    window = {
        border = "single",  -- "rounded", "double", "solid", "none"

## üöÄ Usage

`Navbuddy` command can be used to open navbuddy.

```
:Navbuddy
```

And alternatively lua function `open` can also be used to open navbuddy.

```
:lua require("nvim-navbuddy").open()
```
